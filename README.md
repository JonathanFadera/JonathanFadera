# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒŽ I'm Jonathan Fadera

I'm thrilled to share that I've recently graduated from the prestigious [University of California Berkeley Full Stack Developer Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.berkeley.edu/coding/)! An incredible 24-week journey has allowed me to grow tremendously as a developer and delve deep into technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Handlebars, MySQL, Inquirer, Express, and MongoDB, with a special focus on React lately.

Throughout the bootcamp, I embraced diverse assignments and activities, both individual and collaborative, which significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills and understanding of teamwork. I'm grateful for the support from my instructors and fellow students and the insightful resources introduced during the program.

As I step into the next chapter of my career as a Full Stack Developer, I am committed to continuous learning, keeping up-to-date with the latest tech trends, and creating innovative solutions.

Thank you all for being a part of my journey. I'm excited for what the future holds and can't wait to make a positive impact in the software development world!
